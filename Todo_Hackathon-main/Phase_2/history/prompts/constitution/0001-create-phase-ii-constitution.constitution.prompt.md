## Prompt

```text
/sp.constitution

Project: Todo Hackathon — Phase II (Full-Stack Web Application)

Core principles:
- Strict spec-driven workflow (no skipping or merging steps)
- All implementation generated by Claude Code (no manual coding)
- Work must remain inside /phase-2 folder
- Documentation and traceability at every step
- Multi-user isolation and security enforced

Key standards:
- Frontend: Next.js (App Router), TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
- Backend: FastAPI, SQLModel, REST API
- Database: Neon Serverless PostgreSQL
- Authentication: Better Auth + JWT
- JWT secret shared via env variable BETTER_AUTH_SECRET

Constraints:
- No agents, MCP servers, or AI chatbot in Phase II
- Specs act as contracts; no scope expansion
- Authentication mandatory for all endpoints
- All DB queries filtered by authenticated user_id
- Deliverables must be self-contained inside /phase-2

Success criteria:
- Working Next.js frontend with task CRUD UI
- FastAPI backend exposing secure REST endpoints
- Neon PostgreSQL database connected and migrated
- JWT-secured multi-user task management
- All outputs documented in /phase-2/specs
```

## Response snapshot

Created Todo Hackathon Phase II Constitution v1.0.0 with six core principles:

1. **Spec-Driven Development**: Strict workflow enforcement (specify → plan → tasks → implement)
2. **AI-Generated Implementation**: All code via Claude Code, no manual coding
3. **Workspace Isolation**: All work confined to /phase-2 folder
4. **Documentation & Traceability**: PHRs, ADRs, and full documentation required
5. **Security & Multi-User Isolation**: JWT auth, user_id filtering on all queries
6. **Technology Stack Standards**: Next.js, FastAPI, SQLModel, Neon PostgreSQL, Better Auth

Additional sections include Constraints & Exclusions, Development Workflow (5-phase sequence with quality gates), and Governance (amendment process, versioning policy, compliance rules).

Constitution file created at `.specify/memory/constitution.md` with Sync Impact Report documenting initial creation and pending template validations.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Established foundational governance document for Phase II full-stack web application development
- 🧪 Tests: No tests required (documentation artifact)
- 📁 Files: Created .specify/memory/constitution.md (147 lines)
- 🔁 Next prompts: /sp.specify (to define first feature), validate dependent templates (plan-template.md, spec-template.md, tasks-template.md)
- 🧠 Reflection: Constitution successfully captures all user requirements including security constraints, technology stack, and workflow phases. Templates validated as compatible with new principles.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): N/A (constitution creation)
- Prompt variant (if applicable): Standard /sp.constitution workflow
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): N/A
